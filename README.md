# Ember Learnings from Trek

Trek Glowacki has an excellent writeup clearly detailing how to build a
simple Ember app up from scratch.

As of 9-2-12 it's available at http://trek.github.com

I decided to take those notes and build the app inside a Rails 3 app
with ember-rails. This is that app. I hope you find it useful and give
Trek a shoutout for putting together a really great resource.

## Demo

FYI: it seems to have issues on mobile at the moment.
